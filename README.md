This repository contain code scripts for NLP problems.

Python Spam Detection:
  This folder conatains a jupyter notebook python script file for spam detection NLP problem. Objectives are:
  1. Read and prepare text data. (Remove punctuation, tokenize and remove stop words)
  2. Lemmatize and vectorize(Inverse document frequency) the dataset.
  3. Add extra essiential features if known. Divide data in train and test case.
  4. Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Elastic Net, Multilayer Perceptron Model NN, Random Forest,      Xtreme Gradient Boosting and K Nearest Neighbour)
  5. Test all models on test set.
  6. Plot ROC curve and Precision plots.
  7. Plot probability curve.
  
  Python Spam Detection using Keras(tensorflow backend):
  This folder conatains a jupyter notebook python script file for spam detection NLP problem. Objectives are:
  1. Read and prepare text data. (Remove punctuation, tokenize and remove stop words)
  2. Lemmatize and vectorize(Inverse document frequency) the dataset.
  3. Add extra essiential features if known. Divide data in train and test case.
  4. Train Deep Learning model using Keras with tensorflow as backend. Also train random forest from sklearn to compare.
  5. Test all models on test set.
  6. Plot ROC curve for comparision.
